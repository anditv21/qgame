There are three ways to use this pattern kit.

1. Use the swatches in the swatch palette as fills.

2. Edit one of the six pattern shapes and then drag it to the swatch palette.

3. Use the base tile to create your own. Just make sure Smart Guides are turned on so you can align things perfectly, then copy, rotate and flip the base tile until you have a wicked seamless pattern.

It's free to use for anything, commercial or personal. Have fun, and it would be cool to see what people make with this, so show me if you end up using it.
